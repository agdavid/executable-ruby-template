#What this file does:
  #Overall: this is the sandbox that loads an IRB session so you can play with your program
    #1. loads irb for an integrated ruby session
    #2. defines a method #reload! which uses require_all gem to reload any updated files in 'lib' folder
    #3. requires the 'config/environment', which in turn loads Ruby file dependencies
    #4. starts IRB session

  #Tip: after any change to your 'lib' Ruby files, type the 'reload!' command in irb
  #this will load your updated files into your sandbox
