#What this file does:
  #Overall: this is the entry point into your program by the user.
    #1. shebang tells interpreter that this is Ruby language
    #2. requires the 'config/environment' (which in turn loads your Ruby file dependencies)
  
  #Tip: if typing './bin/name' from Terminal does not execute the program,
    # - type 'ls -lah' - to see list of all human readable attributes
    # - does it have an 'x' - check if attributes has an 'x'
    # - type 'chmod +x name' - add executable attribute to file

  #You can rename this 'name' file to what you want
